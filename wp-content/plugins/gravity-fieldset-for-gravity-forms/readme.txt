*Gravity Fieldset for Gravity Forms is inspired by the post 'Tips on Making Your Gravity Forms as Accessible as Possible' by Cynthia Ng. You can read the whole post <a href="https://cynng.wordpress.com/2014/02/26/tips-on-making-your-gravity-forms-as-accessible-as-possible/" target="_blank">here</a>. Thanks to ovann86 and his <a href="https://nl.wordpress.org/plugins/gravity-forms-infobox-field/" target="_blank">infobox plugin</a> for gravity forms for borrowing the base for our plugin.*

*From version 0.2 and onwards we improved the HTML output to proper fieldsets instead of the closing list item and closing list hack proposed by Cynthia Ng.*
