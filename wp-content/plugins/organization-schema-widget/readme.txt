= How Can I Support? =

The fastest way to get support for this plugin is by visiting the plugin webpage at <a href="http://www.rickrduncan.com/wordpress/organization-schema-widget" rel="nofollow">http://www.rickrduncan.com/wordpress/organization-schema-widget</a>. I don't visit the WordPress.org support forum often enough to know if someone left a support question. So please visit my website if you want a reply. 

= What is schema.org? =

Schema.org was launched June 2, 2011 by Bing, Google and Yahoo! It has been designed to create a common set of schemas for microdata markup on web pages.

= Will using schema.org improve my site’s performance in search? =

Google doesn’t use markup for ranking purposes at this time—but rich snippets can make your web pages appear more prominently in search results, so you may see an increase in traffic.

= Can I disable the Stylsheet? =

Yes! Our options page allows you to disable the use of our stylesheet so that you can write your own styles in your existing stylsheet.
